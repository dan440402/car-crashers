By Daniel Costiuc

Version 3

Created using Python 3 and Pygame.
Based on the tutorials offered on pythonprogramming.net


Description: Play as a car that avoids falling blocks!

Features:
---------
-Main menu screen

-2 cars to choose from (+ 1 "secret" car)

-Functioning game mechanics

-Game Over screen

-Pause feature

-High-score feature

-Functioning buttons


Controls:
---------
Use the mouse to click on buttons and navigate through the screens.

Select a car by clicking on it.

When in-game, use left and right arrow keys to move the car.

Press and hold shift to give yourself boosts (or hold to always go fast).

[Secret] Toggle 'g' for cheat/god mode:

The game will be played for you through a basic AI, and you may find it hard to move the car manually while in this mode (the original idea was to test the AI, though you can try to move if you would like to). Also, due to the nature of the game, you will still inevitably crash around a certain point.

Press 'p' while playing as the car to pause the game, and press 'p' again or click 'Continue' to resume.

Press 'q' while playing as the car to quit the game, or click on "Quit" whenever it is shown.

Press 'b' to go back from the high-score screen to the game over screen, or click on the "Back" button.

Other notes:
------------
If the block hits your car, or your car hits the borders of the window, you will crash (the car).

With each block that falls down, the speed and width of the block increases, thus increasing difficulty.

This is visualized by having the block slowly become more red.

There is no cap for these increases, thus the game will always become exponentially hard after 20 blocks, 
and will be impossible without cheating after 30. 

The purpose of this is to not make the game-play indefinite, and instead make it fun and challenging to get higher scores.

It is also fun to test the cheat/AI mode and see the highest score that it can get.
